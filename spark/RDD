1. RDD Basics
a. Creating an RDD of strings with textFile() in Python
lines = sc.textFile("README.md")
b. Calling the filter() transformation
pythonLines = lines.filter(lambda line: "Python" in line)
c. Calling the first() action
pythonLines.first()
pythonLines.count()
d. Persisting an RDD in memory
pythonLines.persist # cache() is the same as calling persist() with the default storage level

In summarize, every Spark program and shell session will work as follow
e1: Create some input RDDs from external data
e2: Transfrom them to define new RDDs using transformations like filter()
e3: Ask Spark to persist() any intermediate RDDs that will need to be reused
e4: Launch actions such as count() and first() to kick off a parallel computation,
    which is then optimized and executed by Spark
