1. browser automatic tests suits and headless browser platforms capable of scraping.

BROWSER TESTING / SCRAPING:
Selenium - polyglot flagship in browser automation, bindings for Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Haskell and more, 
IDE for Firefox (as an extension) for faster test deployment. Can act as a Server and has tons of features.

JavaScript:
PhantomJS - JavaScript, headless testing with screen capture and automation, uses Webkit. 
As of version 1.8 Selenium's WebDriver API is implemented,
 so you can use any WebDriver binding and tests will be compatible with Selenium
SlimerJS - similar to PhantomJS, uses Gecko (Firefox) instead of WebKit
CasperJS - JavaScript, build on both PhantomJS and SlimerJS, has extra features
Ghost Driver - JavaScript implementation of the WebDriver Wire Protocol for PhantomJS.
new PhantomCSS - CSS regression testing. A CasperJS module for automating visual regression
 testing with PhantomJS and Resemble.js.
new WebdriverCSS - plugin for Webdriver.io for automating visual regression testing
new PhantomFlow - Describe and visualize user flows through tests. An experimental 
approach to Web user interface testing.
new trifleJS - ports the PhantomJS API to use the Internet Explorer engine.
new CasperJS IDE (commercial)

NODE.JS
Node-phantom - bridges the gap between PhantomJS and node.js
WebDriverJs - Selenium WebDriver bindings for node.js by Selenium Team
WD.js - node module for WebDriver/Selenium 2
yiewd - WD.js wrapper using latest Harmony generators! Get rid of the callback pyramid with yield
ZombieJs - Insanely fast, headless full-stack testing using node.js
NightwatchJs - Node JS based testing solution using Selenium Webdriver
Chimera - Chimera: can do everything what phantomJS does, but in a full JS environment
Dalek.js - Automated cross browser testing with JavaScript through Selenium Webdriver
Webdriver.io - better implementation of WebDriver bindings with predefined 50+ actions
Nightmare - Electron bridge with a high-level API.
jsdom - Tailored towards web scraping. A very lightweight DOM implemented in Node.js, it supports pages with javascript.

WEB SCRAPING / MINING
Scrapy - Python, mainly a scraper/miner - fast, well documented and, can be linked with Django Dynamic Scraper for nice mining deployments,
 or Scrapy Cloud for PaaS (server-less) deployment, works in terminal or an server stand-alone proces, can be used with Celery, built on top of Twisted
Snailer - node.js module, untested yet.
Node-Crawler - node.js module, untested yet.
