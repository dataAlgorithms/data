{"url": "/siteinfo/thesource.com", "category": "Society", "name": "Thesource.com", "description": "\nFor 20 years, The Source has been the leading international voice for the ever-evolving world of Hip-Hop music, culture and politics. It is our goal to cover every aspect of this unique and vibrant culture–from the streets that spawn our increasingly creative music and fashion to the power players that direct the boardrooms and make our products into viable commodities and profitable investments. The Source has had unparalled achievements in our 20-year history. While the magazine was undoubtedly the foundation, The Source has created 20 years of content and our accomplishments stretch far beyond the pages of the magazine. Since our inception as a newsletter back in ‘88, The Source has documented everything Hip-Hop like none other, including exclusive interviews in print, on television and online. We have consistently extended our reach beyond the traditional realms of media with special Source music initiatives such as the Hip-Hop Hits compilation, the well reknowned 5 Mic music rating system, Spit 16–our unique program designed to expose unsigned artists, as well as producing the first-ever annual awards program centered on Hip-Hop, The Source Awards. With our eyes and ears steadily to the street, our wealth of content speaks volumes to the double decade history of our coverage and legacy in the game. It is this mission that continues to provide our driving force to be popular culture’s most entertaining, complete and respected brand in Hip-Hop and youth culture. From Source Latino to Source France and Source Japan, the influence of the Source is unrivaled in the global presentation of Hip-Hop. The Source’s coverage is dynamic and remains committed to our growing and diverse audience. Under new ownership, The Source’s NEW ERA will see the brand hitting even larger audiences through a wide-ranging multi-media platform that utilizes traditional methods like TV, radio and of course, the Source’s loyal newsstand base, cohesively with new media outlets like the web and mobile technologies. Without compromise, The Source remains committed to documenting the total lifestyle surrounding Hip-Hop that branches into every niche of popular culture worldwide. There’s a good reason why The Source has dominated as the most recognizable “source” of Hip-Hop and youth culture for the last 20 years."}
