Problem: 

How can we scrapy such follow urls?
Pages are as follow.

example.com/foo/bar/page_1.html
example.com/foo/bar/page_2.html
example.com/foo/bar/page_3.html
...
example.com/foo/bar/page_54.html

Solution:
class MySpider(BaseSpider):
    start_urls = ['http://example.com/foo/bar/page_%s.html' % page for page in xrange(1,54)]
